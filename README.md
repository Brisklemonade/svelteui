## Roadmap & TO-DO's

**Here is where you can find the Roadmap for SvelteUI up to version 1.0**

We would love to hear from you in issues, discussions, and discord to improve the roadmap. As we proceed along our roadmap, we continue to learn. As a result, some of the listed topics may no longer be relevant to us, therefore as the project develops, we might add or remove topics. We will pay close attention to your suggestions and if necessary, modify our plans.

We use certain "Marks" to give you quick indications of the current state of any item in the roadmap. The colorful icons can be displayed by typing `:COLOR_circle:`

Annotation legend:

| Mark            | Description                                        |

| !!              | medium level of priority                           |
