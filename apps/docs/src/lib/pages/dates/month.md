## Usage

Month is the most basic `@svelteuidev/dates` component, it displays a single month without any controls to change current month. This component is used as base for Calendar (coming soon), DatePicker (coming soon) and other components. You can use Month to build custom date or date range pickers that are not included in `@svelteuidev/dates`, but in most cases other components will be more suitable in your application.

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.usage} />

## Localization

All `@svelteuidev/dates` components are built with [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) library.
The default locale is `en`, and to change this, follow the [dayjs localization guide](https://day.js.org/docs/en/i18n/loading-into-nodejs):

```ts
// First import locale data
import 'dayjs/locale/ru';
```

Then set `locale` prop in component:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.localization} />

## First day of the week

Change first day of week with `firstDayOfWeek` prop. It accepts either `sunday` or `monday` as values:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.firstDaySunday} />

## Weekend days

You can set days of week that should be treated as weekend with `weekendDays` prop:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.weekendDays} />

## Range

Highlight date range with `range` prop. Prop accepts an array with two dates, later date must always go last:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.range} />

## Min and max dates

Set `minDate` and `maxDate` props to define minimum and maximum possible dates.
Dates which are not included in available interval will be disabled:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.boundaries} />

## Exclude dates

To exclude dates set `excludeDate` prop with function that receives date as an argument and returns
`true` if date should be disabled. For example, to disable weekends check if date day is 0 or 6:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.exclude} />

## Hide weekdays names

To hide weekdays names row, set `hideWeekdays` prop:

<Demo demo={MonthDemos.weekdays} />

<style>
  :global(article>*:nth-child(3)) {
    margin-top: 20rem!important;
  }
</style>
