## Usage

Anchor is a wrapper around the [Text](core/text.md) component that uses `a` as the root of the element. It supports the same props as the `Text` component. If the link is to be opened in another tab, the prop `external` must be set to `true`.

<Demo demo={AnchorDemos.usage} />

## Usage with svelte-routing and other libraries

It's possible to change the root of the component to use another, for example by using a Link component of a routing library. To do that, it's necessary to pass that component to the prop `root`.

[svelte routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing#readme)

```svelte
<script>
	import { Link } from 'svelte-routing';
	import { Anchor } from '@svelteuidev/core';
</script>

<Anchor root={Link} to="/">Svelte router link</Anchor>
```
