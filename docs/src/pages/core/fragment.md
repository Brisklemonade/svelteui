## Usage

Fragments serve as a cleaner alternative to using unnecessary divs in your code. These fragments do not produce any extra elements in the DOM, which means that a Fragment's child components will render without any wrapping DOM node.

To simply put Fragments enable you to group multiple sibling components without introducing any unnecessary markup in the rendered HTML. The most common use case of fragments is being a wrapper for slotted contents. In most cases, `svelte:fragment` will be used however, SvelteUI Fragment's have extra features that `svelte:fragment` does not.

## Declarative Testing

Fragment can also be used as a declarative version of a Svelte component. Because there are instances when you may need lifecycle or a state within a test but don't want to develop a new component, Fragment comes in handy with this specific use.

To use these methods, set the `mode` prop to `lifecycle`

## Testing Context

If you find yourself needing to test usage of the [context API](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-setcontext), Fragment simplifies this process.
