Instead of remaking the same components, recreating custom actions, transitions, utilities, etc. SvelteUI is designed so you can start making projects quickly. It works amazingly well **out-of-the-box, with zero-configuration, and can be customized** to your liking as your application grows.

### Features

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and SSR Compatible
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) and type definitions are supported, but optional.
- All components are accessible according to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) standards.
- Dark theme included, as well as a custom theming api.
- Minimal third-party dependency usage.
- Easy setup - **Zero Configuration**

### Undocumented Components

The docs are still under construction. Some of the library's exported components & functions are still undocumented. [Here](https://github.com/Brisklemonade/svelteui/issues/15) is where you can keep track of the progress.

<Alert icon={<InfoCircledIcon />} title="Warning" color="yellow">
Please keep in mind that any undocumented component could potentially receive breaking API changes or be heavily updated before being finalized.
